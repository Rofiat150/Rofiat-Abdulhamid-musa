Activity overview
Previously, you learned how to use basic SQL queries to retrieve information from a database. You have also learned about using the ORDER BY keyword to sort data returned in an ascending or a descending order.

In this lab activity, you’ll use SELECT and FROM in SQL to return the information you need from a database. You’ll also use the ORDER BY keyword to sequence the information returned by a query based on a specified column.

It's important to know how to query information from a database because this is a common task you might encounter as a security analyst. You should know how to get the information you need to improve security and keep data safe.

With that in mind, it's time to explore the scenario.

Note: The terms row and record are used interchangeably in this lab activity.
Scenario
In this scenario, you have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.

The information you need is located in the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll obtain information on the employee devices that must be updated. Next, you’ll examine the login attempts for unusual activity. Finally, you’ll use the ORDER BY keyword to sort the data returned by your SQL queries.

OK, let’s get ready to practice running your very first SQL queries!

Note: In this lab you’ll be working with the organization database and the tables it contains.
The lab starts with the organization database in the MariaDB shell that is already open. This means you can start with the tasks as soon as you click the Start Lab button.

If you unintentionally exit the organization database in the MariaDB shell, you can reconnect by running the sudo mysql organization command.

Disclaimer: For optimal performance and compatibility, it is recommended to use either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox browsers while accessing the labs.
Start the lab
You'll need to start the lab before you can access the materials. To do this, click the green “Start Lab” button at the top of the screen.

Lab Start button displayed.

After you click the Start Lab button, you will see a shell, where you will be performing further steps in the lab. You should have a shell like this:

MariaDB Terminal displayed. 

When you have completed all the tasks, refer to the End your Lab section that follows the tasks for information on how to end your lab.

Task 1. Retrieve employee device data
In this task, you need to obtain information on employee devices because your team needs to update them. The information you need is in the machines table in the organization database.

First, you need to retrieve all the information about the employee devices.

Run the following query to select all device information from the machines table:
SELECT *
FROM machines;
Copied!
Note: Using the asterisk (*) returns all data from the specified table. Also, table names in MySQL are case-sensitive.
The output returns all the contents of the machines table:

+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+
| device_id    | operating_system | email_client   | OS_patch_date | employee_id |
+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+
| a184b775c707 | OS 1             | Email Client 1 | 2021-09-01    |        1156 |
| a192b174c940 | OS 2             | Email Client 1 | 2021-06-01    |        1052 |
| a305b818c708 | OS 3             | Email Client 2 | 2021-06-01    |        1182 |
| a317b635c465 | OS 1             | Email Client 2 | 2021-03-01    |        1130 |
| a320b137c219 | OS 2             | Email Client 2 | 2021-03-01    |        1000 |
|...           |                  |                |               |             |
+--------------+------------------+----------------+---------------+-------------+
200 rows in set (0.356 sec)
Next, you want to focus on the email client running on various devices.

Run the following query to select only the device_id and email_client columns from the machines table. Replace X with device_id and Y with email_client:
SELECT X, Y FROM machines;
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT device_id, email_client
FROM machines;
Copied!
The output should return only the selected columns of the machines table:

+--------------+----------------+
| device_id    | email_client   |
+--------------+----------------+
| a184b775c707 | Email Client 1 |
| a192b174c940 | Email Client 1 |
| a305b818c708 | Email Client 2 |
| a317b635c465 | Email Client 2 |
| a320b137c219 | Email Client 2 |
|...           |                |
+--------------+----------------+
200 rows in set (0.015 sec)

What email client is returned in the third row?
Email Client 4
Email Client 3
Email Client 1
check
Email Client 2

Answer: The email client returned in the third row is Email Client 2.

Now, you need information on the operating systems used on various devices and their last patch date.

Complete the query to return only the device_id, operating_system, and OS_patch_date columns from the machines table. Replace X, Y, and Z with the columns that you need to return:
SELECT X, Y, Z FROM machines;
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT device_id, operating_system, OS_patch_date
FROM machines;
Copied!

What is the patch date of the first entry?
2021-12-01
2021-03-01
2021-06-01
check
2021-09-01

Answer: The patch date of the first entry is 2021-09-01.

Retrieve employee device data
Task 2. Investigate login activity
In this task, you need to analyze the information from the log_in_attempts table to determine if any unusual activity has occurred.

First, you need to investigate the locations where login attempts were made to ensure that they’re in expected areas (the United States, Canada, or Mexico).

Write a SQL query to select the event_id and country columns from the log_in_attempts table.
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT event_id, country
FROM log_in_attempts;
Copied!

Were any login attempts made from Australia?
check
No
Yes

Answer: No. Login attempts were not made from Australia.

Next, you need to check if login attempts were made outside of the organization's working hours.

Write a SQL query that selects the username, login_date, and login_time columns from the log_in_attempts table.
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT username, login_date, login_time
FROM log_in_attempts;
Copied!

What username is returned in the fifth row?
mrah
check
jrafael
apatel
dkot

Answer: The username returned in the fifth row is jrafael.

Now, you need to get a complete picture of all login attempts.

Write a SQL query that selects all columns from the log_in_attempts table, using a single symbol after the SELECT keyword.
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts;
Copied!

Investigate login activity
Task 3. Order login attempts data
In this task, you need to use the ORDER BY keyword. You'll sequence the data that your query returns according to the login date and time.

First, you need to sort the information by date.

Run the following query, which orders log_in_attempts data by login_date:
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date;
Copied!

What are the username and login date of the first record returned?
daquino on 2022-05-08
check
ivelasco on 2022-05-08
mabadi on 2022-05-10
sbaelish on 2022-05-10

Answer: The first record returned contains a username of ivelasco and a login date of 2022-05-08.

Now, you need to further organize the previous results by ordering them by login_time.

Modify the query from the previous step by adding the login time to the ORDER BY clause. You must replace X with the appropriate column name:
SELECT * 
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, X;
The correct query to solve this step:

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
ORDER BY login_date, login_time;
Copied!

What are the username and login time of the first record returned by the above query?
pwashing at 00:36:12
gesparza at 00:40:00
wjaffrey at 00:15:55
check
bsand at 00:19:11

Answer: The first record returned contains a username of bsand and a login time of 00:19:11.

Conclusion
Great work!

You have completed this activity, and you now have practical experience in running basic SQL queries to

select specific columns from a table,
select all columns from a table by using an asterisk (*), and
sort query results using the ORDER BY keyword.
These basic queries form the foundation for running more advanced queries and applying filters later.
